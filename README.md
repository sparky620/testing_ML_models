# Machine Learning Models with Scikit-Learn

This repository contains examples of various machine learning models implemented using Scikit-Learn. Each model is trained on small datasets, and hyperparameter tuning techniques are applied to optimize model performance.

## Introduction

In this repository, we explore the implementation of various machine learning models using Scikit-Learn. Each model is trained on small datasets, making it suitable for demonstration and learning purposes. Hyperparameter tuning techniques are applied to optimize the performance of these models.

## Models

### 1. Decision Trees

Decision Trees are a powerful and interpretable machine learning model used for classification and regression tasks. In this repository, we demonstrate how to train decision tree models and visualize their decision boundaries.

### 2. Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and robustness. We showcase the training of Random Forest models and discuss strategies for controlling overfitting.

### 3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a versatile supervised learning algorithm capable of performing classification, regression, and outlier detection tasks. We illustrate the usage of SVM for classification problems and explore the effect of different kernel functions.

### 4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple and intuitive algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. We demonstrate how to train KNN models and discuss the impact of varying the number of neighbors on model performance.

### 5. Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that builds models sequentially, where each new model corrects errors made by the previous ones. We explore the training of Gradient Boosting models and discuss the importance of tuning parameters such as learning rate and tree depth.

## Datasets

The datasets used in this repository are small and well-suited for demonstrating machine learning concepts. These datasets may include synthetic data or publicly available datasets from sources such as UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is crucial for optimizing the performance of machine learning models. In this repository, we employ techniques such as grid search and random search to find the best combination of hyperparameters for each model. We discuss the importance of cross-validation and model evaluation metrics in guiding the tuning process.
